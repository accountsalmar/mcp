## ⚠️ CRITICAL ALERTS FOR REVIEW AGENTS

### 🚫 NON-COMPLIANT ITEMS (Immediate Escalation Required)

- **Professional Indemnity Insurance**: DuraCube does NOT provide PI insurance. Any requirement = NON-COMPLIANT
- **Unconditional Bank Guarantees**: Only dated guarantees accepted
- **Parent Company Guarantees**: Not provided under any circumstances

### ✅ FAVORABLE CONDITIONS (Do Not Flag as Issues)

***

## 1. Limitation of Liability

**Category:** NEGOTIABLE

### 1.1 Original Principle

**Cap of 100% of the Contract value.**

### 1.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Caps DuraCube's total liability exposure to the contract value, protecting against catastrophic financial losses while maintaining reasonable commercial accountability.

**Legal Interpretation**: This creates an aggregate liability cap applying to all claims under the contract. The cap should apply to both direct and indirect damages unless otherwise specified.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Unlimited liability poses existential risk to the business. This principle is critical for financial protection.

### 1.3 Contract Review Guidelines

**Review Triggers**:

- IF contract contains liability provisions exceeding 100% of contract value
- THEN flag for immediate escalation and negotiation

**Red Flags**:

- Unlimited liability clauses
- Caps exceeding 100% of contract value
- Carve-outs that effectively negate the cap

**Negotiation Positions**:

- Preferred: 100% cap on all liability
- Fallback: Higher cap with specific carve-outs for gross negligence only
- Deal-breaker: Unlimited liability exposure

### 1.4 Search Terms and Keywords

**Primary**: "limitation of liability", "liability cap", "maximum liability" **Alternative**: "aggregate liability", "total liability", "liability ceiling" **Related**: "indemnity cap", "damages limitation", "financial exposure"

## 2. Consequential Damages

**Category:** NEGOTIABLE

### 2.1 Original Principle

**Neither party is liable to the other for any consequential loss.**

### 2.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Protects both parties from unpredictable indirect losses, creating mutual protection and commercial certainty.

**Legal Interpretation**: Excludes liability for losses not directly flowing from the breach, including lost profits, lost opportunity, and reputational damage.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Consequential damages can far exceed direct damages and are difficult to quantify or insure.

### 2.3 Contract Review Guidelines

**Review Triggers**:

- IF contract includes liability for consequential/indirect damages
- THEN flag for negotiation to ensure mutual exclusion

**Red Flags**:

- One-sided consequential damage exclusions
- Broad definitions of direct damages that capture consequential losses
- Failure to define consequential damages

**Negotiation Positions**:

- Preferred: Mutual exclusion of all consequential damages
- Fallback: Limited consequential damages with specific caps
- Deal-breaker: Unlimited consequential damage exposure

## 3. Head Contract Provision

**Category:** NON-NEGOTIABLE

### 3.1 Original Principle

**No Head Contract provision: DuraCube is not obligated to accept the terms and conditions outlined in the Head Contract document.**

### 3.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Prevents automatic flow-down of onerous head contract terms, maintaining negotiated commercial position and avoiding unknown liabilities.

**Legal Interpretation**: DuraCube contracts independently with its client, not bound by terms in contracts between the client and third parties.

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Head contract provisions can introduce unvetted terms and significantly expand obligations.

### 3.3 Contract Review Guidelines

## 4. Liquidated Damages

**Category:** NEGOTIABLE

### 4.1 Original Principle

**Limited to a max of 10% of the Contract value, and the Contract must specifically say that LDs are the Principal's sole remedy for delay. Liquidated Damages under the Head Contract are not applicable.**

### 4.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Caps delay-related financial exposure while ensuring LDs are the exclusive remedy, preventing double jeopardy through additional delay claims.

**Legal Interpretation**: Creates a genuine pre-estimate of loss rather than a penalty, with exclusivity preventing other delay-related claims.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Uncapped LDs can consume entire project margin and create significant financial distress.

### 4.3 Contract Review Guidelines

**Review Triggers**:

- IF LDs exceed 10% of contract value

- THEN flag for immediate negotiation

**Red Flags**:

### 5.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Protects against time and cost penalties for delays outside DuraCube's control, ensuring fair risk allocation and preventing erosion of margins.

## 15. Security & Parent Company Guarantees

**Category:** NON-NEGOTIABLE

BG 1 expires on the Practical Completion date. BG 2 expires after the end of Defect Liability Period (52 weeks/12 months). DuraCube does not provide for cash retention. DuraCube does not agree to provide a Parent Company Guarantee.**

### 15.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Limits security to 5% via dated bank guarantees with specific expiry dates, preserving working capital by avoiding cash retention and preventing parent company exposure. Dated guarantees ensure automatic expiry without requiring consent for release.

**Legal Interpretation**: Maximum 5% security via two dated bank guarantees only - first expiring at Practical Completion, second expiring 52 weeks/12 months after PC. No unconditional guarantees, cash security, or parent company obligations.

## 16. Release of Security

**Category:** NON-NEGOTIABLE

### 16.1 Original Principle

**50% of Security is released on the date of Practical Completion of the Contract (BG 1 expires) and 50% upon the expiry date of the defect liability period of the Contract (BG 2 expires after 52 weeks/12 months).**

### 16.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Ensures automatic security release through dated guarantee expiry aligned with risk reduction milestones, improving working capital without requiring consent processes.

**Legal Interpretation**: Automatic release via dated guarantee expiry - BG 1 (2.5%) expires at Practical Completion, BG 2 (2.5%) expires 52 weeks/12 months after PC. No consent or return process required due to dated nature.

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM - Delayed security release or guarantees without expiry dates unnecessarily tie up capital and banking facilities.

## 17. Defects Liability Period

**Category:** NEGOTIABLE

### 17.1 Original Principle

**DuraCube accepts a defect liability period of 52 weeks/12 months from the date of Practical Completion (PC) with no re-warranty period. DuraCube offers a 15 years warranty as per [www.DuraCube.com.au](https://www.DuraCube.com.au) (this is DuraCube's voluntary offering - if not required by customer/contract, this is favorable and compliant).**

### 17.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Limits defects rectification obligation to 52 weeks/12 months. The 15-year warranty is DuraCube's voluntary product warranty offering - if the contract does not require it, this is favorable to DuraCube as it reduces long-term obligations.

**Legal Interpretation**: 52-week/12-month contractual defects period with no extension upon rectification work. The 15-year manufacturer's warranty is offered at DuraCube's discretion per website terms - absence of this requirement in contracts is compliant and favorable.

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM - Extended defects periods beyond 52 weeks/12 months increase long-term exposure. Note: Absence of 15-year warranty requirement is favorable, not a risk.

### 17.3 Contract Review Guidelines

**Review Triggers**:

- IF defects period exceeds 52 weeks or 12 months
- IF re-warranty provisions included
- THEN flag for limitation to 52 weeks/12 months

**IMPORTANT**: If contract does NOT mention or require the 15-year warranty, this is COMPLIANT and FAVORABLE - do not flag as an issue.

**Red Flags**:

- Defects period over 52 weeks/12 months
- Re-warranty on rectification work
- Unlimited defects liability
- DLP calculated in calendar months that may exceed 52 weeks
- Extended warranty requirements BEYOND what DuraCube voluntarily offers

- Standard 52 weeks/12 months DLP only

**Negotiation Positions**:

- Preferred: 52 weeks or 12 months with no re-warranty (no extended warranty requirement)
- Fallback: 18 months maximum DLP
- Deal-breaker: Over 24 months or perpetual re-warranty

### 18.1 Original Principle

**Indemnities, where applicable, will be reciprocal. However, DuraCube can agree to non-reciprocal terms, provided they are reduced proportionally.**

### 18.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Ensures balanced risk allocation through mutual indemnities or proportional reduction of one-sided obligations.

**Legal Interpretation**: Preference for reciprocal indemnities with flexibility for proportionally reduced non-reciprocal arrangements.

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Unlimited one-sided indemnities create uncapped exposure.

### 18.3 Contract Review Guidelines

## 19. Proportionate Liability Act

**Category:** NON-NEGOTIABLE

### 19.1 Original Principle

**The Proportionate Liability Act must not be excluded in the Contract.**

### 19.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Ensures liability is apportioned according to actual fault, preventing DuraCube from bearing 100% liability for partially caused losses.

**Legal Interpretation**: Preserves statutory protection under state proportionate liability legislation, preventing joint and several liability.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Exclusion could result in full liability for losses only partially caused by DuraCube.

### 19.3 Contract Review Guidelines

### 20.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Protects DuraCube's interests by retaining title until payment while transferring risk only upon accepted delivery.

- IF risk transfers before acceptance
- IF title transfers before payment
- THEN flag for standard transfer terms

**Red Flags**:

- Risk transfer on delivery without acceptance
- Title transfer before payment

**Category:** NEGOTIABLE

### 23.1 Original Principle

### 24.2 Explanatory Notes

## 25. Insurances

**Category:** NON-NEGOTIABLE

### 25.1 Original Principle

**DuraCube will provide the following insurance:

- Public Liability Insurance -General: $20M
- Public Liability Insurance -Product: $20M
- Contract Works Insurance material damage: max project Value $400k
- Professional Indemnity Insurance: Not Applicable - DuraCube does not provide Professional Indemnity Insurance

Specifies that DuraCube does not provide insurance policies in joint names and will be listed as an interested party. If a customer requires Professional Indemnity Insurance, this principle is NON-COMPLIANT and needs clear departure documentation that DuraCube does not provide Professional Indemnity Insurance.**

### 25.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Defines maximum insurable limits aligned with DuraCube's coverage, avoiding gaps between contractual requirements and available insurance. Professional Indemnity is not carried as DuraCube does not provide professional design services.

**Legal Interpretation**: Specific insurance types and limits with absolute exclusion of professional indemnity requirement. Any PI requirement triggers non-compliance requiring formal departure.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Insurance requirements exceeding available coverage create uninsured exposure. Professional Indemnity requirement is a critical non-compliance issue.

### 25.3 Contract Review Guidelines

**Review Triggers**:

- IF insurance requirements exceed stated limits
- IF professional indemnity required AT ALL
- IF joint names insurance required
- THEN flag for alignment with available coverage

**Red Flags**:

- Preferred: Insurance as per stated limits, NO Professional Indemnity
- Fallback: Project-specific additional coverage if paid (except PI)
- Deal-breaker: Professional Indemnity Insurance requirement (requires formal departure if proceeding)

**Special Note on Professional Indemnity**:

- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE - DuraCube does not carry PI insurance
- Any PI requirement must be formally documented as a departure
- Client must acknowledge in writing that DuraCube does not provide PI coverage
- Consider if contract should proceed without PI coverage

## 26. Protection of Works

**Category:** NEGOTIABLE

### 26.1 Original Principle

**No provision shall be made for the protection of works following the completion of DuraCube's installation.**

### 26.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Limits responsibility to DuraCube's active work period, avoiding ongoing protection costs and liability after installation.

**Legal Interpretation**: Protection obligations cease upon completion of DuraCube's installation scope, transferring to principal or subsequent contractors.

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM - Extended protection obligations create ongoing cost and risk exposure.

- THEN flag for removal of post-completion requirements

## 27. Time is of the Essence / Escalation

**Category:** NEGOTIABLE

### 27.1 Original Principle

**Not applicable.**

### 27.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Prevents minor delays from becoming fundamental breaches and avoids automatic price escalation obligations.

**Legal Interpretation**: Time is not of the essence, meaning delays don't automatically constitute fundamental breach. No escalation provisions apply.

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM - Time of essence clauses can trigger severe consequences for minor delays.

### 27.3 Contract Review Guidelines

**Review Triggers**:

- IF time is of the essence included
- IF escalation clauses present
- THEN flag for removal

**Red Flags**:

- Time of the essence provisions
- Automatic termination for delay
- Price escalation clauses
- No flexibility for minor delays

**Negotiation Positions**:

- Preferred: Complete exclusion of both concepts
- Fallback: Limited to specific critical milestones only
- Deal-breaker: Blanket time of essence provision

## 28. Design Liability

**Category:** NON-NEGOTIABLE

### 28.1 Original Principle

**DuraCube does not accept undefined liability. DuraCube's design scope is limited to the provision of the shop drawings.**

### 28.2 Explanatory Notes

**Business Impact**: Limits design responsibility to shop drawings only, avoiding professional liability exposure for design work beyond expertise. This aligns with DuraCube not carrying Professional Indemnity Insurance (see Principle 25).

**Legal Interpretation**: Design liability strictly limited to shop drawing preparation, not extending to design adequacy or performance. No professional design services provided.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Undefined design liability creates professional exposure without corresponding insurance (DuraCube does not carry PI insurance).

### 28.3 Contract Review Guidelines

**Review Triggers**:

- IF design liability beyond shop drawings
- IF fitness for purpose obligations
- IF professional design services required
- THEN flag for limitation to shop drawings only

**Red Flags**:

- Broad design responsibilities
- Fitness for purpose warranties
- Performance guarantees
- Design certification requirements
- Requirements for Professional Indemnity Insurance (see Principle 25)

**Negotiation Positions**:

- Preferred: Shop drawings only, no design liability
- Fallback: Shop drawings with limited review
- Deal-breaker: Full design liability or fitness for purpose

**Cross-Reference**: See Principle 25 - DuraCube does not provide Professional Indemnity Insurance as no professional design services are offered.
