Project: test-cli-app
Type: cli_tool
Description: A simple CLI tool to test the agent system
Created: 2026-01-12 14:02:16

## Project Overview
This is a CLI tool project designed to test the long-running agent system.
The project includes 48 discrete, testable features across multiple categories:
- Setup & Configuration
- Core Commands
- Output Formatting
- Logging
- Error Handling
- Interactive Features
- Progress Indicators
- Testing
- Documentation
- Packaging
- Code Quality

## Session Log

### Session 1: Initialization (2026-01-12 14:02:16)
**Agent**: Initializer Agent
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Created project directory structure (src/test_cli_app/, tests/, docs/)
- ✅ Created features.json with 48 testable features
- ✅ Initialized this progress log (claude-progress.txt)
- ✅ Created initialization script (init.ps1) for Windows
- ✅ Created comprehensive .gitignore for Python projects
- ✅ Created README.md with project overview and documentation
- ✅ Initialized git repository
- ✅ Made initial commit: "Initial project setup by Initializer Agent"

**Project Structure Created**:

└── docs/                  # Documentation directory (empty)
```

**Features Summary**:
- Total Features: 48
- Priority 1 (Critical): 5 features - Setup & core initialization
- Priority 2 (High): 4 features - Core commands
- Priority 3 (Medium): 12 features - Output, logging, error handling
- Priority 4 (Normal): 15 features - Interactive, progress, testing
- Priority 5 (Low): 12 features - Documentation, packaging, polish

**Next Steps for Coding Agent**:
1. Start with Priority 1 features (F001-F005):
   - F001: Project structure verification
   - F002: Create pyproject.toml
   - F003: Create __init__.py and __main__.py
   - F004: Set up argument parsing
   - F005: Implement CLI entry point
2. Work through features sequentially by priority
3. Mark features as "passes: true" in features.json when complete
4. Update this progress log after each session
5. Run tests regularly to ensure quality

**Notes**:
- Project structure follows Python CLI best practices
- Features are discrete and testable
- All features start with passes: false
- Git repository is initialized and ready
- init.ps1 can be run to set up virtual environment

**Handoff to Coding Agent**:
The project infrastructure is complete and ready for implementation.
The Coding Agent should begin with priority 1 features to establish
the basic CLI structure, then proceed through higher-priority features
before moving to documentation and polish items.
