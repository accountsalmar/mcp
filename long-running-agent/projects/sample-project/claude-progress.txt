# Claude Progress Log
Project: sample-project
Type: generic (with dependency tracking)
Created: 2026-01-12

## Dependency Graph
```
F001 (Setup) ------> F002 (User Model) ------> F003 (Repository)
                           |                         |
                           +------------+------------+
                                        |
                                        v
                              F004 (UserService)
                                        |
                                        v
                              F005 (Authentication)
```

## Interface Contracts
- UserInterface: Implemented by F002, used by F003, F004
- RepositoryInterface: Implemented by F003, used by F004
- UserServiceInterface: Implemented by F004, used by F005

## Session Log

### Session 1 (Demo - Manual)
- Completed: F001 (Project Setup), F002 (User Model)
- Status: 2/5 features complete (40%)
- Next: F003 (UserRepository) - only implementable feature

### Compatibility Notes
- F002 implements UserInterface - DO NOT CHANGE signature
  - get_id() -> string
  - get_email() -> string
  - validate() -> bool
- Any changes to User model require updates to F003, F004

## Next Session Should:
1. Implement F003 (UserRepository)
2. Follow RepositoryInterface contract
3. Write integration tests for F002 + F003
4. Update this file with interface notes
